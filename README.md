# IA-DIP

IA-DIP is a project that simulates forest fires and uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the spread of the fire. The project comprises two main sections: the simulation and the prediction.

## Simulation

The simulation module is implemented using Python, with assistance from the NumPy and Pandas libraries.

Our simulation represents a forest as a 2D grid. Each cell in this grid signifies a patch of forest that can either be on fire or not. The spread of the fire is influenced by wind direction and intensity, and the likelihood of a cell catching fire depends on the states of its neighboring cells.

## Prediction

The prediction module employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor from the sklearn library. The model predicts the final state of the forest given the initial conditions and wind data, and is trained on data generated by the simulator.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.8 or a newer version. Additionally, it relies on the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- sklearn

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas sklearn

## Installation

Clone the project to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IA-DIP.git

## Usage

To use this project, first, run the simulation to generate data:

python Modelo.py

This will simulate a forest fire and save the initial and final states of the forest to a CSV file.

To train and test the prediction model using the generated data, use the following command:

python Predictor.py

The Predictor will train an MLP Regressor using the generated data and print out the prediction results on the console.
